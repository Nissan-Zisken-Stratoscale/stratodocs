# Applications 

## Overview

Symphonyâ€™s Applications functionality allows you to create VMs with enterprise apps already on board. This can be done in either of two ways:

-   With pre-packaged VM-based stacks of enterprise apps, found in the **[Applications - Image Marketplace](https://www.stratoscale.com/knowledge/image-marketplace)** view.
-   Via an applications wizard which enables IT teams and service providers to offer additional enterprise apps. This functionality is found in the **[Applications - Catalog](https://www.stratoscale.com/knowledge/catalog)** view.
