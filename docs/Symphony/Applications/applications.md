# Applications 

## Overview

Symphonyâ€™s Applications functionality allows you to create VMs with enterprise apps already on board. This can be done in either of two ways:

-   With pre-packaged VM-based stacks of enterprise apps, found in the **[Applications - Image Marketplace](https://www.stratoscale.com/knowledge/image-marketplace)** view.
-   Via an applications wizard which enables IT teams and service providers to offer additional enterprise apps. This functionality is found in the **[Applications - Catalog](https://www.stratoscale.com/knowledge/catalog)** view.


# Marketplace

Symphony enables you to create VMs from images with applications already on-board. These images are pulled from Bitnami's online marketplace.

**To download an image with an application on-board**:

1. From the  **Applications**  option on the Main Navigation pane select  **Image Marketplace**.

The Applications - Image Marketplace view appears.

2. Click on the image from which you wish to create a VM.

The window for downloading the application image appears, focused on the selected application image.

3. Select the **Storage Pool** into which you will download the selected image and click **Download**. After several minutes the new image will appear in the Images menu.

For additional information, you can reference the Bitnami website for the image you have downloaded.
