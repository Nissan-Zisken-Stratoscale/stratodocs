## Overview

# Creating EC2 Credentials

In order to use AWS API client software outside of the system UI you need the appropriate access key and secret key.

**To obtain or generate an access key and secret key**:

1. Click  **Menu**  >  **Account Management**  >  **Access Keys**. This displays the access and secret keys for each project in your system.

2. Find the project whose keys you want and copy the access key and the secret key for that project (click the copy icon next to each key).

# Getting Started with the AWS CLI

# AWS CLI Overview

You can use the AWS CLI to interact directly with Symphony. Supported AWS services include EC2 and S3.

For example:

-   You can use the AWS CLI with the EC2 service to create a Symphony VM.
-   You can use the AWS CLI with S3 to copy a file to Symphony object storage. This can be helpful if you want to make things like images, software distributions, media files, and static HTML files available to your Symphony object storage users.

There are two ways to use AWS CLI commands with Symphony:

-   From within the Symphony GUI, you can  [use the AWS console](https://www.stratoscale.com/knowledge/use-aws-console).
-   You can also  [install and configure the AWS CLI software](https://www.stratoscale.com/knowledge/install-and-configure-aws-cli)  independent of the Symphony GUI, and use that to interact with Symphony.
