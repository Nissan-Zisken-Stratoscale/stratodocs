# Symphony Release Notes v5.1.3

# What's New

## General

An enhanced tagging mechanism is now available for image tagging. Enhancements include:

-   Enhanced tag based filtering capabilities and flexibility (compatible with the AWS tagging and filtering paradigm).
-   New "System" tag type. Its visibility scope is public. It can be administered only by a system admin.
-   On behalf tagging. For example, a system admin can tag images in different projects, as if they were tagged by project members. This functionality is subject to an image's scoping rules.
-   JSON formatted tags. All tagging related APIs now support JSON formatted tags as input. (Note that the previous format remains supported for backward compatibility.)
-   Improved tag manipulation/filtering performance and data availability model.

## Cloud Services

**Database Service**

-   Database instance metrics. Metrics are now being collected from running database instances (MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL). The metrics collected are database specific. You can see a full set for any point in time by using the dbs instance get API. A smaller set of metrics for each database is stored and can be queried as a time series. For this version, database metrics are visible only to admin users.
-   DBS restore from volume. You can now specify an existing unattached DBS data volume during the DBS Instance Create action to restore the database. The supported databases are: MariaDB, MySQL and Postgresql.
-   New cluster engine - Redis 4
    -   AOF has been enabled (see https://redis.io/topics/persistence).
    -   The grow, shrink and assign parameter group actions are currently not supported.
    -   Slot management is the responsibility of the user.
-   New cluster engine - MongoDB 4
    -   The expand, reduce, and assign parameter groupactions are currently not supported.
    -   The deployment of services is homogeneous, so all nodes are the same instance type and each one runs a data shard, a config server (each part of a replication set) and a query router.

**Certificate Service**

-   ACM APIs. AWS compatible APIs have been added for the Certificate Service. Currently supported APIs are:
    -   ListCertificates
    -   GetCertificate
    -   DescribeCertificate
    -   DeleteCertificate
    -   ImportCertificate
-   Provide certificate to Database service via Terraform. It is now possible to pass a certificate that was imported into the Certificate Service to RDS via Terraform. To do this add a tag to the operations called “_ReservedCertArn” with the value specified as the ID of the certificate returned from the Certificate Service.

**Container Registry Service**

-   EIP Support - When you create a container registry, you can now provide or auto-provision an elastic IP (EIP).

## Autoscaling Groups

Scaling groups are now autoscaling groups. You can now define scaling policies that automatically adjust desired capacity according to predefined metrics. You define scaling policies via the second tab of the Create Auto-Scaling Group dialog:

![](https://www.stratoscale.com/wp-content/uploads/asg.png)

-   Min size and max size are now mandatory, and desired capacity is now optional and defaults to min size.
-   Only Target Tracking scaling policies are supported.
-   The predefined metric type ALBRequestCountPerTarget is not supported, but the other three are supported: ASGAverageCPUUtilization, ASGAverageNetworkIn, ASGAverageNetworkOut
-   The predefined metric types ASGAverageNetworkIn, ASGAverageNetworkOut are measured in 5s intervals. This means that the threshold should be 1/12 (if using 1m intervals) or 1/60 (if using 5m intervals) of the threshold in AWS. Except for the different scaling of the threshold, the behavior is the same.
-   The desired capacity of an autoscaling group can be changed manually even if it has scaling policies. However, this does not prevent the system from changing the desired capacity to the computed value. In other words, any manual intervention will probably be overridden (but see next bullet) by the computed value based on the scaling policies that are defined at the moment.
-   The minimum desired capacity of an autoscaling group will never be automatically set to 0. This is because if the group has no VMs than it has no resource usage metrics and hence no alarms will be triggered and the scaling policies will never take effect. As a result, if the desired capacity is manually changed to 0 then it will not be changed by scaling policies. This behavior is necessary in order to allow users to delete autoscaling groups: if an autoscaling group has instances it cannot be deleted.
-   After the desired capacity of an autoscaling group is changed the system will wait until the number of instances matches the desired capacity before it generates new alarms. If the desired capacity cannott be reached than the alarm will still be in ALARM state and the next action for the same policy to be taken upon that alarm's state will be delayed by up to 10 minutes. Other scaling policies may affect the group size up to 4 minutes after the last change in the group's VM count.
-   Under rare circumstances, scaling policies might not be activated for 15 minutes (or more) after their conditions are met.
-   Multiple scaling policies can contradict each other (e.g., scaling policy with low CPU threshold together with scaling policy with high network out threshold). In any case, in order to give your applications enough resources, the system will set the group's desired capacity to be the maximum computed value across all scaling policies. In other words, if a scaling policy of network out computed that 7 VMs are needed, and another scaling policy of CPU computed 2 VMs, then the group's desired capacity will be 7.

## VM and User Management

-   Added T3 and R5 predefined instance types.
-   Added a new API to import AWS credentials and associate them with a symphony user. The goal of this feature is to allow users to work with same credentials in Symphony and AWS at the same time if they wish to do so or use the same credentials for 2 Symphonies. Automated tools can use the common credentials and not have to use different sets for the two platforms.API details:
    -   The  _identity/users/<user id>/credentials/ec2_  API was updated and can now get two more parameters in the body:
        -   `access_key_id`: AWS access key
        -   `secret_access_key`: AWS secret key

![](https://www.stratoscale.com/wp-content/uploads/ac_key.png)

## Storage

-   Added API and UI screens to allow control of the speed of Ceph recovery. This allows the admin to make tradeoffs of recovery speed vs the impact on workloads IOPs.
-   Added VM and Pool storage metrics for external storage.
-   Enhanced the upload image operation to avoid leaving temporary volumes when the operation failed.

## Health Monitoring

-   Diagnostics
    -   In order to allow easier identification of platform issues, we exposed a diagnostics API.
    -   Its main use is to identify issues that are not exposed through system status (events, entities) and to provide a Tier 3 support tool.

## UI

Top utilized disks was added to the region overview dashboard:

# Notable Bug Fixes

-   BK-6396 When taking a node to maintenance, if it took more then 20 minutes to migrate all workloads to other nodes, the migration was stopped and needed to be done manually before completing the maintenance flow.
-   SYMP-6405 When running the Symphony CLI from an external machine, the command output was formatted incorrectly.
-   PIC-2949 vmcore fills the log partition upon crash.
-   STOR-3660 Better handling of going into and out of maintenance.
-   STOR-3656/STOR-3654 Better reporting of pool/disk health.
-   DBAAS-1505 - Fix VM leak after load balancer delete.
-   DBAAS-1503 - ELB API - Target Group should accept private IP for target.
-   DBAAS-1470 - Simple Mode LDAP is now supported for PostgreSQL

# Known Issues and Limitations

## Storage

-   Adding disks to a Ceph pool. When you add disks to a Ceph pool (either when creating the pool or later), the process is serialized. When you create a pool with a lot of disks, the pool can be initially created with a subset of the disks, and then some of the disks might go back to an unused state. The workaround is to re-add these disks to the pool.

## VM and User Management

-   When you create an instance with an IP that is already assigned to another instance, the instance is created in an error state, and the event is missing the real failure reason.

## Images

-   Creating an image from a public snapshot is not supported, and may change another image's scope if both the old and the new images have different scopes and point to the same snapshot.
-   After you upgrade to 5.1.3, all existing “private” admin tags on images become “public” system tags.

## Cloud Services

Database service:

-   [DBAAS-1523] The RDS-API  `describe-db-engine-versions`  currently returns Symphony engine version names instead of AWS compatible names.
-   [DBAAS-1644] If a database instance or cluster takes more than 10 minutes to provision, it will show in an “Error” state for some time before switching to “Active”.

Kubernetes service:

-   [DBAAS-1452] A newly created Kubernetes cluster will go through the “Degraded” status before completing and displaying “Running”.

## Autoscaling Groups

-   An admin user cannot update a scaling group unless they are logged in to the project where the scaling group was created. The error message will be about unknown subnet/security groups even if they weren’t modified during the update.

# Dark Site Service Images for v5.1.3
